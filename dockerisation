#Javascript app deployment

mkdir hello-docker # this is our repository (similar to creating a repo in git)
cd hello-docker
code # open this in vscode (or your favourtite code editor)
# create a new app.js java script (to write a program in Java)
console.log ("Hello docker!");
#To ship this application (program) with docker to a different computer is complex
#To use docker
#create a Dockerfile (no extension)
#write inside the Dockerfile instruction for packaging our application
#start from a base image (is has a bunch of file) and add additional file to it.
#The images are built on top of different distributions of linux
#(check hub.docker.com)
#instruction inside dockerfile is as given below
FROM node:alpine # (: is a tag, meaning we are specifying linux destribution alpine from the node image)
COPY ./app #to copy our program files from the current directly into the image we have inside the app directory
WORKDIR /app
CMD node app.js #We are creating a command to execute the app
#all the instructions above assume that we are currently inside the app directory. The document our deployment process

#packaging our app.js application
docker build -t hello-docker . #we use a period to specify where  our docker file can be found (the current directory)

#To see all the images
docker images ls

#we can not run this image on any computer running docker
docker run hello-docker #hello-docker is the image and contains all the files for running our application
#Can run it alternatively if it is hosted as in image in dockerhub
docker pull dockeraddress/image-name
#to view the image
docker image ls
#to run the image
docker run dockeraddress/image

#to load ubuntu (as an image) from dockerhub and use its command
docker pull ubuntu
#alternatively
docker run ubuntu # looks for the images if it's on your computer and pulls from hub if it's not
docker ps # shows the list of running proceses or containers
docker ps -a #displays all running (including hidden) containers
docker run -it # we are staring a container interatively and loading the ubutu image that we have loaded locatlly
#the above starts a shell prompt where we can execute linux commands

#BUILDING images
docker ps #to view containers
